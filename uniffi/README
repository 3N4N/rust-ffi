This is a sample project for testing UNIFFI.

1. First you need to build the rust library.

    $ cd lib/math/
    $ cargo build

2. Then you can compile the Kotlin project with gradle.

    $ ./gradle build

3. To run the kotlin project, provide the location of the rust library.

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/math/target/debug/ ./gradlew run
